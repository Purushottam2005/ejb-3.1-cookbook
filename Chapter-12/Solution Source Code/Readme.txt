These directories contain the code used for each of the recipes in Chapter 12.

The files in each of the directories represent the "solution" for that recipe.  However, some recipes contain multiple parts which may or may not build upon each other.  In this case, some parts of the code may be commented out with a brief description of that part of the recipe the code sequence addresses.

Short code sequences found the the There's More section may not appear in the source code.
